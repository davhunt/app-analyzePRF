# app-analyzePRF documentation

This app takes the time-series fMRI data of an individual subject performing a retinotopy task (bold.nii.gz), and derives voxel-wise pRF (population receptive field) measurements from their visual response to a stimulus (stim.nii.gz) using the [analyzePRF toolbox](https://github.com/kendrickkay/analyzePRF). In this model a static, compressive nonlinearity is applied to the modeled BOLD response before PRFs are fit, in line with findings that spatial summation in human visual cortex is compressive.

Visually responsive voxels (or grayordinates) are analyzed and properties of each grayordinate is extracted from the fMRI data.  PRF measurements include the grayordinate's r^2 (variance explained), receptive field angle, eccentricity, and size (std of the Gaussian), as well as the (typically compressive) exponent of the Gaussian used to model the receptive field's visual response contrast, the gain describing the pRF model, and the mean signal intensity.

[![pRF parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davhunt/pictures/master/Screenshot%20from%202019-04-17%2014-41-11.png)

A mask (mask.nii.gz) in the same dimensions as the fMRI bold image can be passed in (V1, for example) to specify which voxels to analyze. Otherwise the cortical ribbon between white and pial surfaces from the Freesurfer will be used by default.

The stimulus stim.nii.gz must match the temporal dimension (TR) of the fMRI, and so each time point of the stim.nii.gz is generated by averaging together the aperture images around that time point (avg_images.m).

## Running the App 

analyzePRF is a MATLAB toolbox for fitting population receptive field (pRF) models
to fMRI data.  It is developed by Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu).

### For HCP subjects

HCP subject voxel-wise fMRI data can be downloaded from db.humanconnectome.org.

In a 7T subject's "7T_RET_fixextended" folder, preprocessed retinotopy BOLD data can be found at: MNINonLinear/Results/tfMRI_7T_RETCCW_AP_RETCW_PA_RETEXP_AP_RETCON_PA_RETBAR1_AP_RETBAR2_PA/tfMRI_7T_RETCCW_AP_RETCW_PA_RETEXP_AP_RETCON_PA_RETBAR1_AP_RETBAR2_PA_hp2000_clean.nii.gz

### On Brainlife.io

You can submit this App online at [https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.177](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.177) via the "Execute" tab.

### Running Locally (on your machine)

1. git clone this repo.
2. Inside the cloned directory, create `config.json` with something like the following content with paths to your input files.

```json
{
    "fmri": "./input/fmri/bold.nii.gz",
    "stim": "./input/stimulus/stim.nii.gz"
}
```

3. Launch the App by executing `main`

```bash
./main
```

## Output

All output files will be generated under the current working directory (pwd). The main output of this App is the "prf" directory which contains NIFTI files polarAngle, eccentricity, receptive field size (rfWidth), R2, exponent, gain, and mean volume of each grayordinate.

### Dependencies

This App only requires [singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) to run.
